0.5 months for this particular project i had regular discussions with the\\npackaging team to create the best daisy chain structures for a wlp chip which i had work on previously.\\ni also went through the entire process of tape out of this chip which included uploaded tapeout related files to the database and\\nreviewing the ejv sent to the fab.\\nwtr qlna metal variants tapeout 180nm (tsmc) : duration of project - 0.5 months we needed metal variants for the qlna chip\\nwhich i previously worked on.\\nin design we leave scope for meal options which can be used to study certain features better during testing.\\nhere i worked on creating four chips with different metal variant options.\\ni also went through the entire process of tape out of this chip which included uploaded tapeout related files to the database and\\nreviewing the ejv sent to the fab.\\nwtr qlna in 180nm (tsmc) : duration of project - 5 months this was my first project in 180nm tsmc process.\\nin this project i mentored one other junior in my team who worked on mbias block while i worked in creating the lna.\\nwtr rx bbf in 28nm (tsmc/umc) : duration of project -

4 months this task was about working on fbrx module which was previously done.\\nthere we few issues seen with this blocks performance in post silicon verifications.\\nmy role in this task was to identify the iq imbalance which caused performance issues and fix them.\\ni was able to meet the designers requirements in this task and was very much appreciated by him once the task was done.\\nwtr low band low noise amplifier 28nm (tsmc) : duration of project - 3 months this is a low band lna which operates between\\n860 - 900 mhz frequencies.\\nhere layout constraints like coupling, inductance and symmetry were taken care while doing layout.\\nmajorly the input devices to which rf_in signal were given extra care w.r.t coupling and symmetry.\\nwtr mixer, attenuator in 28nm (tsmc) : duration of project - 10 months this is the first project which i worked on in rf domain and i\\nhad a wonderful experience working on this project.the blocks that i worked in this project were for a product chip and hence the amount of learning was tremendous in this project.\\nthe blocks were ready on time with good quality.\\nsenior analog layout engineer\\n \\n, \\n10/2011\\n \\nto \\n12/2012\\n \\ncompany name\\nmember of technical staff\\n \\n, \\n06/2006\\n \\nto \\n09/2011\\n \\ncompany name\\neducation and training\\nbachelor of engineering\\n \\n:\\n \\nelectrical and electronics\\n \\n,\\n \\n2006\\n \\nvisvesvaraya technological university\\n \\nï¼\\u200b \\ncity\\n \\n, \\nindia\\n \\nelectrical and electronics\\nskills\\ncadence, data management, database, debugging, features, iq, layout, layout design, linux, meetings, mentor, windows, migration, next,\\noperating systems, packaging, progress, project management, quality, real time, router, routers, sun-solaris',\n",
